# Converting to native
See if we can export to HTML to be able to export direct to PDF without needing Excel. 

Pandas has a built-in formatter, is it powerful enough to do what I need?

It can also export to Excel, so can we maintain the excel functionality, just do it all within Pandas? would be nice.
